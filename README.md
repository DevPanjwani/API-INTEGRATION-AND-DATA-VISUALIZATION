##​This project was developed during my CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS internship. The task focuses on fetching regional demographic data from a public API and creating visual insights to understand population distribution across the Americas.

​Using the REST Countries API, this application retrieves data for all countries in the North, South, and Central American regions, analyzing the relationship between land area and population density.

​Features:
​Zero-Auth API Integration: Connects to the REST Countries API without requiring an API key for seamless data access.
​Demographic Analysis: * Identifies and ranks the Top 10 most populous nations in the Americas.
​Visualizes the correlation between landmass (Area) and Population.
​Advanced Visuals: Uses Logarithmic Scaling on scatter plots to effectively display data across countries of vastly different sizes (e.g., USA vs. Caribbean islands).

​Technologies Used:
​Python 3.x

​Libraries:
​requests: To handle HTTP requests and JSON data.
​pandas: To clean and structure country-specific attributes.
​seaborn & matplotlib: To generate high-fidelity statistical plots.
